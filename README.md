![Screenshot of the first task](../AdminLabs/Media/email-trigger.png)
What I did in this task:
- Added a simple outlook trigger V2 (when a new email is sent, I will receive the alert)


![Screenshot of the second task](../AdminLabs/Media/http-trigger.png)

What I did in this task:
- In this task I added "when a HTTP request is received" trigger and configured the new action button
which means when http request is received, I will receive a trigger. As you can see
on the screenshot, I tested it and it's working.
